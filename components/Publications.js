<h2>Open Standards</h2>
<p>Open standards are publicly available specifications that offer a wealth of economic and technological benefits. Governments around the world are considering mandating open standards, especially in the area of document formats.</p>

<h2>Role of Defaults</h2>
<p>Defaults are pre-selected options chosen by the manufacturer or the software developer. Users tend to defer to these pre-selected options. Policymakers can take advantage of this deference in setting defaults.</p>

<h2>How Software (and Architecture) Affects Users</h2>
<p>This work has largely focused on identifying features or characteristics of code that have significance in regulating behavior. These characteristics are manipulable and are considered governance characteristics, because of their ability to differentially influence behavior. This work has led us to focus on open standards and defaults.</p>

<h2>Development of Software</h2>
<p>This work focuses on the development of software with an emphasis on the role of several institutions including universities, firms, consortia, and the open source movement is examined. For each institution, the analysis examines their internal processes and norms that affect the development process. The analysis also examines how each institution emphasizes different social and technical attributes that are embedded in code.</p>

<h2>How Government Can Shape Software</h2>
<p>Government can influence the development of code in many ways. This section focuses on the governmentâ€™s regulatory power, fiscal power, and the ability to influence intellectual property rights.</p>

<h2>History of the Internet</h2>
<p>The Internet's origins date back to the 1960s with government funded research into computer networks. This work traces the history and implications of shifting control over the Internet to the private sector, a process called privatization.</p>
